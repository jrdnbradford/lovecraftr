The copyright status of H. P. Lovecraft's fiction is a source of some controversy.
For many works, like "The Call of Cthulhu", any copyright would have already expired.
For others, it is unclear who owns the copyright if it exists.

The most detailed examination is almost certainly Chris J. Karr's
["The Black Seas of Copyright"](https://www.aetherial.net/lovecraft/index.html),
which concludes that the fiction works have entered the public domain.
